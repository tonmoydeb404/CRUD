# CRUD

CRUD operation is everywhere. so i've decided that i will create CRUD operation based project with different type of technology like (Vanilla JS, React JS, Node JS, MongoDB, MySql). so this is the first one which is created with Vanilla JS. Also i will try to use this design in all projects. So you can say that it is just boilerplate for future CRUD Projcts.

## Envoice - CRUD Operation With JS

this is vanilla JS project which one used in shop to list customer orders. I've used localstorage as a database. so now things you can do :

-   Add products in list with price and quantity.
-   Edit products details.
-   Delete product.

:star: Special Features :

-   You can sort lists.
-   Also you can customly sort list by drag an drop (click on list id and drag where ever you want).
-   You can search in lists.
-   You can print the table.
-   You can export JSON file of your lists.
